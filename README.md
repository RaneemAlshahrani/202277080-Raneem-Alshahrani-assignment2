<!-- ================= Assignment 2 Update Required ================= -->

<!-- ToDo(A2-1):
Update the project description to explicitly mention:
- Dynamic content feature (e.g., filtering, live search, expandable sections)
- Data handling (localStorage / validation / API)
- Animations and transitions
- User feedback (empty state / success / error messages)
-->

<!-- ToDo(A2-2):
Verify repository name and folder name are correct:
Replace any occurrence of "assignment1" with "assignment2".
-->

<!-- ToDo(A2-3):
Update the GitHub clone URL to point to the assignment2 repository.
-->

<!-- ToDo(A2-4):
Update the Short Summary of AI Use section to include
how AI assisted specifically in Assignment 2 features.

# Project description
This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my background, projects, and skills in a clear and organized way. I designed and structured the website to reflect my work and present it professionally. AI tools were used strategically during development for minor suggestions, debugging support, and refining certain parts, while the overall concept, design, and content were developed independently by me.

# Short summary of AI use
AI tools were used during development to assist with small improvements, debugging minor issues, and refining certain sections of the code. The overall structure, layout, design decisions, and content of the website were created independently by me. A detailed explanation of AI usage is provided in `ai-usage-report.md`.
